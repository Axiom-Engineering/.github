### 🏛️ System Architecture
Axiom is built on a **Polyglot Microservices Architecture**, ensuring high availability and independent scalability of AI workloads.

- **[axiom-service-core](https://github.com/Axiom-Engineering/axiom-service-core)**: The Enterprise Core. Built with **Java & Spring Boot** to manage security, RBAC, and business logic.
- **[axiom-service-ai](https://github.com/Axiom-Engineering/axiom-service-ai)**: The AI Brain. A **Python-based RAG service** using LangChain and Vector Databases for project-specific intelligence.
- **[axiom-app-web](https://github.com/Axiom-Engineering/axiom-app-web)**: The Command Center. A professional **React & TypeScript** dashboard for Admins and team members.
- **[axiom-app-mobile](https://github.com/Axiom-Engineering/axiom-app-mobile)**: The Mobile Assistant. A **React Native** application providing instant access for engineers on the go.
- **[axiom-infra-aws](https://github.com/Axiom-Engineering/axiom-infra-aws)**: The Backbone. **Dockerized** environments managed via CI/CD pipelines on **AWS**.
